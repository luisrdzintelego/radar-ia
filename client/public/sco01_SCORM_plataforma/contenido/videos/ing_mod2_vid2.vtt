Throughout our lives,

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:17.784
each of us must acknowledge we have unconscious biases.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.620
However, today we will share some tips

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.123
to manage and coexist with these biases,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.491
let us get to it!

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.660
First tip: make sure you ask opinions

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.630
from people with different characteristics to yours,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.533
these can be due to context, job posts,

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.337
departments, geography, and gender, among others.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.106
Even if it means making an extra effort.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.512
Second tip: use respectful and inclusive language

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.916
and avoid referring to people using derogatory or discriminatory terms.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:54.721
Do not forget, language is key for empathizing and connecting with other people,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.525
it helps us make them feel comfortable and understood.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.162
Third tip: pay attention to your surroundings,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.331
make use of all your senses,

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:08.668
and make sure everyone feels comfortable and understood.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:13.039
Afterwards, make sure they have the chance to talk and contribute.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:14.707
Fourth tip:

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.512
Intently look for people to meet and listen to and who are different to you,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:23.116
this accelerates the identification and management of biases.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:29.622
Fifth tip: Make a pause to identify which situations make you feel uncomfortable,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.392
think about your reaction,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.228
become aware of this, and use it

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.730
when you next interact with others.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.001
To do this, you need to remain alert,

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.338
aware, and present in your surroundings.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.074
Keep in mind that this JEDI path

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.377
is based on being thoughtful in our daily interactions

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.380
