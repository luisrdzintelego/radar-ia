Do you know how we experience diversity at FEMSA?

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.047
Fostering diversity means treasuring and celebrating

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.415
the richness of each individual.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.185
We see diversity as all the different channels

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.322
where people can travel on the JEDI road,

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.891
and how it contributes something unique to the journey

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.894
and enriches the experience on this shared road.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:32.966
Some people walk, others ride bikes or cars, and some skate.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.468
Diversity means opening spaces,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.638
including, and boosting other points of view

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:44.210
to ensure access and development in our company, regardless of diversity.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.847
We are committed to embracing the JEDI model,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:51.051
which guarantees the conditions

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.253
that make people feel valued,

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:59.059
included, and respected for their singularities, differences, and skills.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.962
Join us on our way to achieving diversity at FEMSA!

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.497
Together,

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.133
we make a more powerful and more diverse team,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.971
where every individual feels welcomed and can contribute their value and shine.
