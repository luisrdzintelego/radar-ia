00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:11.378
How do you experience inclusion?

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.881
Fostering inclusion means creating safe and trusting environments

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.885
where everybody feels welcomed,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.188
valued, and free to be who they are.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.259
Inclusion means making sure every traveler

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.462
feels welcomed and safe on the road.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.766
For example, making sure there are enough

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.969
resting areas, pedestrian crossings,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.441
special lanes for bicycles, safety elements for the visually impaired,

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.911
and even charging stations for electric vehicles.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.082
At FEMSA, we create an environment where every person

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.185
feels welcomed and valued,

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.789
by identifying and managing our own prejudices

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.960
and by being aware of our biases, we make sure everybody

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.930
has the chance to grow and shine.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.267
We are committed to adjusting our systems

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:12.639
to guarantee access and growth to each diversity

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.842
through an inclusive organizational culture

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.312
that includes activities for education and for raising awareness,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:25.285
an internal and external communication strategy, and the training of JEDI ambassadors.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:29.456
Join us in this path to inclusion at FEMSA!

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.725
Together, we can build a culture

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.728
where every person feels a sense of belonging

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:40.033
by being accepted for who they are and by being valued and acknowledged.
