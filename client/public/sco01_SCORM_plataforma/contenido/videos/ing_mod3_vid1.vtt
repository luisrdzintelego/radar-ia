00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.876
After traveling on the JEDI path,

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.613
we are about to face challenges that test
our inclusive behavior.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.583
The time has come to put our knowledge into action

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:19.586
and practice inclusive leadership in different situations.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.791
Each interaction is an opportunity
to guarantee fair and equitable behavior,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.427
one that promotes diversity and guarantees inclusion.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.697
How will you use your leadership to create a JEDI environment?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.600
Show us that inclusive leadership is not just a theory,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.436
but a daily practice that transforms lives.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:41.207
With every decision we make,
we have the power to build a stronger FEMSA.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.211
Together, we can make a difference and build a future

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.115
where diversity is celebrated, and inclusion is the norm.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.217
Are you ready for the challenge?

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.687
