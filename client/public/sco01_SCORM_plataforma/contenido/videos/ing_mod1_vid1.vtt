00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.043
Do you know what justice is?

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.746
FEMSA knows that having a fair company

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.014
is much more than a goal.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.118
Guaranteeing an environment where everyone

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.953
has the same opportunities is a responsibility.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.158
Justice should be the cornerstone of our processes and policies.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.494
It means designing or adjusting

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.963
systems that are fair for all,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.399
no matter their circumstances,

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:38.705
and making sure every person has the same opportunities to access, grow, and develop,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.374
without giving up who they are.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.477
Justice is like designing a road.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.581
We must ensure it is evenly paved

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:52.018
and with clear signposts and enough light,

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:56.890
so that it is accessible, and everyone can travel on it safely.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.494
This is why we have pledged to a transparent governance and management system,

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:04.931
where accountability is essential.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.835
Growing together means breaking down barriers

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.338
that impede our own or other peopleâ€™s development

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.207
and, apart from enhancing opportunities,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:18.078
be ourselves and contribute all our talent,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.814
be authentic and have a sense of belonging.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.949
Join us on the path to justice!

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.685
Together, we can make a difference.
