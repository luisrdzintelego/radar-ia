00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.076
Let us explore a powerful skill

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.247
that can change the way we connect, interact, and collaborate:

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.615
empathy.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.952
Get ready to submerge yourself in genuine understanding!

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.655
Empathy is like walking in another person’s shoes,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.126
but it is also diving deep into their experiences,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.694
understanding their feelings,

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.631
and seeing the world through their eyes and, from my privileged position,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.899
springing into action.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.501
It is more than being sympathetic,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.070
it is a genuine emotional connection.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.739
Empathy takes us beyond words,

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.509
it dips us into emotions and allows us to understand

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.978
points of view in a unique manner.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.481
Imagine a world where everyone can see the struggles,

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.085
challenges, and joys of those who are not like us.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.422
Empathy allows us to do exactly that.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.857
From the point of view of inclusion,

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.060
it becomes a powerful tool

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.596
where I feel and act on the reality of the other person.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.067
Bringing down barriers and fostering understanding.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.235
When we practice empathy,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.238
we are not only acknowledging the biases and inequality

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.840
other people endure,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.509
it also motivates us to act.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.747
It is a call to action to build a fairer world.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.317
It helps us create an environment where every voice

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:29.689
and point of view is heard, acknowledged, respected, and considered,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.059
thus promoting equity and inclusion.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.562
Isn’t it exciting being a part of this?

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.165
When used actively and genuinely,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.101
empathy helps us build bridges,

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.038
overcome differences, and collaborate.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.341
Be an agent of change with every act of empathy!
