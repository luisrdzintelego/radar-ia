Hi! I'm Alessandra Carrascoza

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:15.081
and we are here to find out about the basics of
FEMSA’s JEDI Normative together.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.584
Let us get to it right away!

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:21.254
FEMSA’s regulations are a set of principles and guidelines

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.291
directing our actions and decisions in
every department of the company,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:30.063
today we will review those that are
directly linked to the JEDI Rule,

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:36.636
which focuses on setting clarity and direction
to our actions in the company

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.207
within a framework of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion,

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.878
translating these in guidelines and behavior.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:49.649
These guidelines focus on recognizing
and treasuring diversity

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.919
in every level of FEMSA,
fostering an environment

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.589
where every voice is listened to and respected.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.830
This translates into specific actions, such as the inclusion
of diverse points of views in the decision-making processes,

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:08.468
and the creation of safe spaces for open
and constructive conversations.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:11.805
In this context,
governance is essential

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.241
and it helps us guarantee the
JEDI Rule is implemented effectively

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.945
and integrated in every department of the company.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.780
This implies, for example

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.584
setting monitoring policies, procedures, and mechanisms

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:29.489
that promote the transversality of JEDI in all our operations.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.525
We invite you to learn more about it

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.862
and to find out how the JEDI path can change our day to day.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.033
