Do you promote equity in your environment?

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:11.911
At FEMSA,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.882
this means the approaches and resources adapt

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:21.021
to the needs and contexts of each person.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.956
In our road,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:27.260
equity can compare to access ramps, crossings,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:32.232
bike lanes, signposts, or other facilitators that let everybody

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.735
advance on the path according to what they need.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:39.672
In other words, equity becomes a tool

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.941
that adjusts to the environment and systems,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.446
so they adapt to the individual needs of each person.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.117
We have made a commitment to identifying tactical gaps

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.354
and to reviewing and adjusting key processes,

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.058
such as recruitment, hiring, and accessibility

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:02.228
so we can guarantee the same conditions for everyone.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.266
Together, we can build an environment

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.336
where every person feels valued and respected.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.607
Thank you for joining us in our commitment to equity!
