00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.211
Do you know what privilege is?

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.783
Today we will explore a key concept that impacts our perception of the world:

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.585
privilege.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.955
Imagine privilege as a bag full of advantages,

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.492
possibilities, opportunities, and benefits.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:29.863
These advantages, possibilities, opportunities, and benefits

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.464
can first relate

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:36.102
to gender, age, sexual orientation,

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:41.441
disabilities, religion, nationality, or any other unique characteristic that we may possess

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:46.312
but, how can we recognize privilege for what we have or what we decide?

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:50.116
Acknowledging our own privilege is fundamental.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.921
It is like turning on a light in a dark room full of possibilities.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:59.759
It helps us see the advantages we have when compared to other people.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.162
Here is the exciting part:

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.933
by acknowledging our own privilege, we can use it positively.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:12.305
It is a call to action to strike down barriers and to connect with others,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.441
making the road easier to travel on,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.144
fighting discrimination, and fostering equity.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.916
Recognizing our privilege helps us act with intention

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.185
and be aware of our position.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.886
From where we stand,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.990
we can offer support and take down barriers that hinder the participation of others

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.428
as well as obstruct their access to opportunities and growth.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.230
To sum up,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.669
recognizing our own privilege is not just a task, it is an opportunity!

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.939
A chance to open up a world of possibilities

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.543
in the construction of a fair road for all people.
