00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.977
Do you understand well what empathy is and is not?

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.481
Get ready to find out in this 1-minute journey.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.517
First, let us forget the classic rule that goes

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.954
“do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.025
The quote is valuable, indeed, but empathy goes deeper.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.228
Empathy is not about being compassionate

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.231
and projecting our feelings onto others.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.501
It is much deeper and authentic than that.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.669
It is not assuming.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.671
Each person is unique,

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.574
we must be aware that we have different histories,

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.577
experiences, and points of view.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.648
You cannot assume you know exactly what others are feeling

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:53.253
since each one of us has different ways to look at the world.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.290
Furthermore, it is not about imposing your solutions

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.893
or comparing their experience to yours.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:05.999
Empathy is paying attention, and understanding, before you go on offering your help or advice.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.169
Empathy is the ability to pay attention,

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.972
understand, and respect the experience and background of others

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.909
without projecting your own assumptions.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.711
It means observing, recognizing, and validating

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.748
the feelings of other people to understand;

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.285
it is not an automatic assumption based on your preferences.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:30.857
Our task is to go beyond and question the basic rules.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.092
Let us pay attention,

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.129
understand, and build genuine and real connections.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.667
Make empathy your strength for building a stronger team

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.771
and for creating a JEDI environment where everyone can shine!
