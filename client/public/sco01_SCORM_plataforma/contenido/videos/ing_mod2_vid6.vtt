00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.843
As we have seen along the route,

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.412
the characteristics of inclusive behavior

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.415
are explained here in our Inclusion Triad.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:20.987
This Triad says that behaving inclusively means

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:26.159
building skills that allow us,
on the one hand, to manage our own bias;

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.131
recognizing and acting based on our privilege,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:36.536
and, last but not least, to act in an intentionally empathetic manner,

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.041
which implies a permanent and cyclical
exercise that will help us to ensure

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.711
that we are promoting people instead of building barriers

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.781
and walls that make it impossible for people to develop.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.685
Instead of walking alone paying attention to the individual progress we make on the road,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.721
we must act with empathy,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.491
acknowledging the fact that everyone
has a right to the same chances.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:03.163
Inclusive behavior prioritizes access for all people,

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.667
not despite their differences and characteristics,
but because of them.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.471
When we position ourselves on an inclusive intent,

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:19.179
we are trying to open spaces where
everybody can simultaneously grow.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.417
Our biases are, in a nutshell, different ways to filter and sort the world

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.755
according to the individual lenses we use throughout our whole lives.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.091
Everyone has biases,

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.528
and to make sure we are being fair and equitable,

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:41.234
we need to recognize them to make sure
we are not closing doors for diversities.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.871
When we are aware of our privilege

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.742
we must act on it so we can eliminate barriers

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.446
and we must act to maximize diversity,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.583
boost the uniqueness of people,

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:00.053
and ensure that our common goal is achieved

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.189
on account of the different characteristics we have.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.693
Inclusive people who are aware of their biases

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.063
make sure to stop and think before speaking,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.934
thus avoiding the automatic responses
that all human beings emit

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:20.573
as a consequence of previous experiences,
personal or even cultural filters.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.977
By focusing on what we share as humans,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.881
we acknowledge that, despite our individual differences,

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.651
we all share a human dignity.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.253
This perspective

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:37.457
allows people to feel valued, understood, and accepted,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.727
which in turn motivates them to be more authentic

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.898
and to act confidently in a diverse and complex world.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.401
Do not forget that the Inclusion Triad

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.105
offers an invitation to acknowledge
and manage our own biases,

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:56.609
identify our position of privilege, and behave with empathy.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.812
By integrating these principles in our day to day,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:06.152
we can build an environment where
every person feels valued and respected.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.256
Make sure to support everyone on their path,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.293
so we can promote an inclusive leadership at FEMSA.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:17.864
Start today by practicing the Triad of
Inclusive Leadership and make a difference!
